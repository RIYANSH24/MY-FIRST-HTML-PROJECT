    <p> Hello! I’m Riyansh, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Digital Marketing at Jagannath University. Before this, I graduated from Virendra Public School, where I focused on the science stream and earned a silver medal in wrestling and a gold medal in tug of war. My passion for table tennis keeps me active and engaged outside of academics. I also enjoy creating creative projects, traveling, and exploring new cuisines. With a keen interest in digital marketing, I am dedicated to leveraging my skills to take my father’s business to the next level. Excited about the future, I’m looking forward to making a significant impact in the business world!</p>
